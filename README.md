# List Pagination and Filtering Project

List pagination is the application of breaking out data (like a list of people, posts, or product items) across pages for the user to toggle between instead of scrolling. List pagination provides the user the ability to view data in increments of 10 or 20 items per page, instead of having them scroll endlessly. This project also offers a filtering feature allowing the user to search for a specific list item by name. Building pagination and filterting helped test and solidify my knowledge regarding basic JavaScript syntax, Web API's, and friendly user features.

This project is part of the Treehouse Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree. This project belongs to Unit 02 - List Pagination and Filtering. The web page will paginate a list of students at 10 students per page and will allow the user to toggle between the sets (pages) of students.

The project also adds functionality to dynamically search the list of students in the page. The search will filter and paginate the students according to the text search term entered in the search bar. If no students are found that include the user's search criteria a "No Results Found" message is displayed to the user.
