# techdegree-project-02

This project is part of the Treehouse Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree. This project belongs to Unit 02 - List Pagination and Filtering. The web page will paginate a list of students at 10 students per page and will allow the user to toggle between the sets (pages) of students.

The project also adds functionality to dynamically search the list of students in the page. The search will filter and paginate the students according to the text search term entered in the search bar. If no students are found that include the user's search criteria a "No Results Found" message is displayed to the user.
